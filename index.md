    excerpt: Movement is a fundamental process of life, with profound implications for the structure of populations and communities. I investigate the movement behaviour of coastal fish species to characterise key biological traits, including social structure, activity rhythms, and space- and habitat-use patterns. My work aims to provide a mechanistic understanding of how fish respond to environmental drivers and anthropogenic pressures.

    title: <div style='color:#036972'>Tracking technologies</div>
    excerpt: My research relies on emerging tracking technologies that allow the study of free-ranging fish in their natural environment. I use acoustic telemetry systems ranging from fine-scale positioning arrays to large-scale monitoring networks. I combine these tools with statistical and modelling approaches to interpret the large volumes of data they generate and to make robust inferences about previously unobserved behavioural patterns across temporal and spatial scales.

    title: <div style='color:#036972'>Marine Protected Areas</div>
    excerpt: Marine protected areas (MPAs) are effective management tools to mitigate human impacts on marine ecosystems. Through long-term monitoring programmes, I examine how MPAs promote the recovery of exploited populations and enhance ecosystem resilience. I also assess how MPAs respond to emerging threats, including extreme events such as marine heatwaves, to understand better their role in sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in a climate change scenario.

I am a biologist fascinated by marine ecosystems in general, and by fish in particular. My research focuses on fish behaviour, using emerging tracking technologies to study how they move, interact, and respond to environmental change and human pressures. I also investigate the role of marine protected areas in biodiversity conservation and the sustainable use of marine resources. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Mediterranean Institute of Advanced Studies (IMEDEA, CSIC-UIB) in Mallorca, Balearic Islands.
